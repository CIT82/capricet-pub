# My Day 
## *Morning* :partly_sunny:
1. Woke up at 9:30 ish in the morning and took a shower and did my face routine.
2. After leaving the bathroom I saw that my son was **still sleeping** so I went and started on breakfast
because he usually wakes up after smelling pancakes.
## *Afternoon* :cloud_with_rain:
A little bit after making breakfast my son woke up :smiley: So we sat together while he ate and watched *Cocomelon*.
After relaxing for a bit we got dressed because I had to run some errands.
Which included:
- Cashing my check and putting it in the bank.
- Paying a bill.
- Taking a trip to Target to get some necessities. 
- Going to get something to eat.
## *Evening/Night* :sleeping:
I ended up taking my son to a restuarant we had never been to for dinner and **the food and service was so bad that I left a bad review.**
That experience left me in a sour mood for a while. After getting home we did our night routine which consists of bath time, brushing teeth, 
and tidying each room for 10 minutes. 
After our routine, we headed to bed to relax and cuddle and eventually fall asleep. Thank God for another day.
